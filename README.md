### c4me
NOTE:

James (Me - kinda a dummy), has been committing from my windows partition instead of my Ubuntu.
However, GRUB has been messing with my timeslot, so I've been committing in GMT.


**How to Install**

Installing is simple and easy! First, make sure you have [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/] (MySQL) and[https://nodejs.org/en/download/] (nodeJS) installed.

If you have node installed properly, you also have npm! Npm used to mean node package manager, now it is quite literally meaningless.

The project has a variety of dependencies that npm can install quite easily. Simply cd into the respective directories (c4me and backend)  and type "npm install".

NPM will look for the dependencies in the packages.json and install them. From there, everything should be installed! Type npm start to begin the servers.
